    For every sportsman and healthy lifestyle enthusiast, who trains in a gym, creation and
    maintenance of training plan is important part of his/her progress. If particular
    training system or complex is being composed incorrectly, most likely it will eventually
    cause so-called "plate state" - when you stuck and can't progress anymore. In some cases
    it can even cause regression in weights. This is where you need GymStrength! So what is
    exactly GymStrength? It's a software/service which helps to compose and maintain
    training plan. Furthermore, it has embedded analysis modules which are very useful for
    tracking own progress.
